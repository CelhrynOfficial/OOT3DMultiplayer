# Ocarina of Time 3D Multiplayer Mod

This mod is based on the amazing work done by [Gamestabled's OoT3D Randomizer](https://github.com/gamestabled/OoT3D_Randomizer), with most of the multiplayer features initially implemented by [Kewlan](https://github.com/Kewlan). My work, alongside Estuko's, was focused on stripping away the randomizer aspects to create a standalone multiplayer mod.

However, I must express my deepest regret regarding the course of this project. Due to my lack of honesty about certain aspects, the team behind this project ultimately dissolved. I am truly sorry for how things turned out.

## Added features

While the core of the mod remains heavily based on the work of others, we managed to add a few features, including:

- Different tunic colors for players.
- A notification system.
- Minor additional tweaks.
- Partial actor synchronization (finishing this shouldn't take long for a motivated developer).

## Future Plans

Due to the drama and circumstances surrounding the project, there will likely never be an official release. However, it is not impossible that I might revisit this concept one day, possibly for **Majora's Mask 3D**.

## Acknowledgements

A big thanks to the [OoT3D Randomizer team](https://github.com/gamestabled/OoT3D_Randomizer) for their work, as well as the team at Kirbymimi for their collaboration. Without them, none of this would have been possible.

Once again, I'm truly sorry for how things ended.
